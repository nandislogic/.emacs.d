# Emacs Configuration

This is my emacs configuration tree, continually used and tweaked.
Emacs itself comes with support for many programming languages. 

Works well with Ruby, Python, Javascript, Haskell and a number of
other languages.

## Supported Emacs versions

The config should run on Emacs 23.3 or greater and is designed to
degrade smoothly - see the Travis build - but note that Emacs 24 and
above is required for an increasing number of key packages, including
`magit`, `company` and `flycheck`, so to get full you should use the
latest Emacs version available to you.

Some Windows users might need to follow
[these instructions](http://xn--9dbdkw.se/diary/how_to_enable_GnuTLS_for_Emacs_24_on_Windows/index.en.html)
to get TLS (ie. SSL) support included in their Emacs.

## Credits

This configuration is based on the starter kit provided by [Steve Prucell](https://github.com/purcell). However, since cloning his repo, I have been making consistent changes with the config.
Please feel free to poke around the code.
